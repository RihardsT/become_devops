# Main task
Build a server that does something you care about.  
Think of a simple application, maybe a website that you would like to make
and then make while using the common DevOps tools and concepts.

## About
A "learning guide" on what I think is necessary to become a DevOps engineer.

## Top tips
Make notes!  
It's known, that writing solidifies stuff in memory, so write stuff down.  
While writing with hand is better for memory, imo, it's not that good for IT.  
I recommend creating a repository for notes. Easy to search.  
For example, I have https://github.com/RihardsT/forgettables repository with
with stuff that I have encountered and think that I will need in the future.  
I recommend making something similar, to have a reference for yourself.
