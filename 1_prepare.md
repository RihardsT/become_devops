### 1. Get Linux - WSL
Internet runs on Linux, so you have to get it too, in some way.  
Assuming you're on Windows, follow this and set up Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Alternate option is to set up the same using VirtualBox instead,
better yet using Vagrant, but WSL is fine.

### 2. Password safe and choose an editor
Store your passwords somewhere safe, because there's always more and more
accounts that need to be made.  
Basically choose whatever place you like to store your passwords.  
Be it Firefox or whatever browsers password storage or dedicated password
safe services like LastPass or so.  
I personally like https://keepass.info/, because that is stored only locally.

Generate long random passwords, because why not, if you have a password safe.

Choose your favorite text editor for local work.
